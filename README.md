Fibona Chicken Game.

The balance of everything in the world can be found in the golden ratio.
It was the Fibonacci sequence that solved this mathematically.
There were prophets earlier, some who revealed the relationship between chicken and the Fibonacci sequence
They appreciate their never-ending spirit of inquiry and their willingness to benefit humans and chicken widely
I took a moment to code poorly, so I'll call it a Fibonacci calculator.
